# Sorting Algorithms GUI

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing various sorting algorithms. The application allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

This will launch the GUI, where you can select different sorting algorithms and visualize their sorting process.
